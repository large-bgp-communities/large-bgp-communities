                   draft-ietf-idr-large-community-07

Abstract

   This document describes the BGP Large Communities attribute, an
   extension to BGP-4.  This attribute provides a mechanism to signal
   opaque information within separate namespaces to aid in routing
   management.  The attribute is suitable for use with four-octet
   Autonomous System Numbers.

1.  Introduction

   BGP implementations typically support a routing policy language to
   control the distribution of routing information.  Network operators
   attach BGP communities to routes to associate particular properties
   with these routes.  These properties may include information such as
   the route origin location, or specification of a routing policy
   action to be taken, or one that has been taken, and is applied to all
   routes contained in a BGP Update Message where the Communities
   Attribute is included.  Because BGP communities are optional
   transitive BGP attributes, BGP communities may be acted upon or
   otherwise used by routing policies in other Autonomous Systems (ASes)
   on the Internet.

Internet-Draft            BGP Large Communities            November 2016


   BGP Communities attributes are four-octet values [RFC1997].  Common
   use of this attribute type splits this single 32-bit value field into
   two 16-bit values.  The most significant word is interpreted as an
   Autonomous System Number (ASN) and the least significant word is a
   locally defined value whose meaning is assigned by the operator of
   the Autonomous System in the most significant word.

   Since the adoption of four-octet ASNs [RFC6793], the BGP Communities
   attribute can no longer accommodate the above encoding, as a two-
   octet word cannot fit a four-octet ASN.  The BGP Extended Communities
   attribute [RFC4360] is also unsuitable, as the protocol limit of six
   octets for each community value cannot accommodate both a four-octet
   Global Administrator value and a four-octet Local Administrator
   value.  This limitation precludes the common operational practice of
   encoding a target ASN in the Local Administrator field.

   To address these shortcomings, this document defines a BGP Large
   Communities attribute encoded as one or more twelve-octet values,
   each consisting of a four-octet Global Administrator field and two
   four-octet operator-defined fields, each of which can be used to
   denote properties or actions significant to the operator of the
   Autonomous System assigning the values.

2.  BGP Large Communities Attribute

   This document creates the BGP Large Communities attribute as an
   optional transitive path attribute of variable length.  All routes
   with the BGP Large Communities attribute belong to the communities
   specified in the attribute.

   The attribute consists of one or more twelve-octet values.  Each
   twelve-octet BGP Large Communities value represents three four-octet
   values, as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                      Global Administrator                     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                       Local Data Part 1                       |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                       Local Data Part 2                       |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Global Administrator:  A four-octet namespace identifier.

   Local Data Part 1:  A four-octet operator-defined value.

Internet-Draft            BGP Large Communities            November 2016


   Local Data Part 2:  A four-octet operator-defined value.

   The Global Administrator field is intended to allow different
   Autonomous Systems to define BGP Large Communities without collision.
   This field MUST be either one of the reserved values as defined
   below, or an Autonomous System Number (ASN).  If it is a reserved
   value, then the Local Data Parts are as defined by the reserved
   value.  If it is an ASN then the Local Data Parts are to be
   interpreted as defined by the owner of the ASN.  When used in small
   closed environments, the values MAY be any values.  Thus,
   implementations MUST allow the operator to specify any value for any
   of the fields.

   There is no significance to the order in which BGP Large Communities
   are encoded in the BGP path attribute payload.  A BGP speaker can
   transmit them in any order.

   Duplicate BGP Large Communities SHOULD NOT be transmitted.  A
   receiving speaker SHOULD silently remove duplicate BGP Large
   Communities from a BGP UPDATE message.

3.  Aggregation

   If a range of routes is aggregated, then the resulting aggregate
   should have a BGP Large Communities attribute which contains all of
   the BGP Large Communities attributes from all of the aggregated
   routes.

4.  Representation

   Large BGP Communities MUST be represented as three separate unsigned
   integers in decimal notation in the following order: Global
   Administrator, Local Data 1, Local Data 2.  Numbers MUST NOT contain
   leading zeros; a zero value MUST be represented with a single zero.
   For example: 64496:4294967295:2, 64496:0:0, or (64496, 111, 222).

5.  Reserved BGP Large Community values

   The following Global Administrator values are reserved: 0 (the first
   ASN) [RFC7607], 65535 (UINT16_MAX) and 4294967295 (the last ASN)
   [RFC7300].  Operators SHOULD NOT use these Global Administrator
   values.

   Although this document does not define any Special-Use BGP Large
   Communities, the Global Administrator values specified above could be
   used if there is a future need for them.

6.  Error Handling

   The error handling of BGP Large Communities is as follows:

   o  A BGP Large Communities attribute SHALL be considered malformed if
      the length of the BGP Large Communities value, expressed in
      octets, is not a non-zero multiple of 12.

   o  A BGP UPDATE message with a malformed BGP Large Communities
      attribute SHALL be handled using the approach of "treat-as-
      withdraw" as described in section 2 [RFC7606].

   The BGP Large Communities Global Administrator field may contain any
   value, and a BGP Large Communities attribute MUST NOT be considered
   malformed if the Global Administrator field contains an unallocated,
   unassigned or reserved ASN or is set to one of the reserved BGP Large
   Community values defined in Section 5.

7.  Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP has similar security implications as BGP
   Communities [RFC1997].

   This document does not change any underlying security issues
   associated with any other BGP Communities mechanism.  Specifically,
   an AS relying on the BGP Large Communities attribute carried in BGP
   must have trust in every other AS in the path, as any intermediate
   Autonomous System in the path may have added, deleted, or altered the
   BGP Large Communities attribute.  Specifying the mechanism to provide
   such trust is beyond the scope of this document.

   Network administrators should note the recommendations in Section 11
   of BGP Operations and Security [RFC7454].

8.  Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   As of today these vendors have produced an implementation of BGP
   Large Communities:

   o  Cisco IOS XR

   o  ExaBGP

   o  GoBGP

   o  BIRD

   o  OpenBGPD

   o  pmacct

   o  Quagga

   The latest implementation news is tracked at
   http://largebgpcommunities.net/ [1].

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has made an Early Allocation of the value 32 (LARGE_COMMUNITY)
   in the "BGP Path Attributes" registry under the "Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP) Parameters" group and is now asked to make that
   Permanent.
