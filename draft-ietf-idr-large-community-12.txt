Abstract

   This document describes the BGP Large Communities attribute, an
   extension to BGP-4.  This attribute provides a mechanism to signal
   opaque information within separate namespaces to aid in routing
   management.  The attribute is suitable for use with all Autonomous
   System Numbers including four-octet Autonomous System Numbers.

1.  Introduction

   BGP [RFC4271] implementations typically support a routing policy
   language to control the distribution of routing information.  Network
   operators attach BGP communities to routes to associate particular
   properties with these routes.  These properties may include
   information such as the route origin location, or specification of a
   routing policy action to be taken, or one that has been taken, and is
   applied to all routes contained in a BGP Update Message where the
   Communities Attribute is included.  Because BGP communities are
   optional transitive BGP attributes, BGP communities may be acted upon
   or otherwise used by routing policies in other Autonomous Systems
   (ASes) on the Internet.

Internet-Draft            BGP Large Communities             January 2017


   BGP Communities attributes are a variable length attribute consisting
   of a set of one or more four-octet values, each of which specify a
   community [RFC1997].  Common use of the individual values of this
   attribute type split this single 32-bit value into two 16-bit values.
   The most significant word is interpreted as an Autonomous System
   Number (ASN) and the least significant word is a locally defined
   value whose meaning is assigned by the operator of the Autonomous
   System in the most significant word.

   Since the adoption of four-octet ASNs [RFC6793], the BGP Communities
   attribute can no longer accommodate the above encoding, as a two-
   octet word cannot fit a four-octet ASN.  The BGP Extended Communities
   attribute [RFC4360] is also unsuitable.  The six-octet length of the
   Extended Community value precludes the common operational practise of
   encoding four-octet ASNs in both the Global Administrator and the
   Local Administrator sub-fields.

   To address these shortcomings, this document defines a BGP Large
   Communities attribute encoded as an unordered set of one or more
   twelve-octet values, each consisting of a four-octet Global
   Administrator field and two four-octet operator-defined fields, each
   of which can be used to denote properties or actions significant to
   the operator of the Autonomous System assigning the values.

2.  BGP Large Communities Attribute

   This document defines the BGP Large Communities attribute as an
   optional transitive path attribute of variable length.  All routes
   with the BGP Large Communities attribute belong to the communities
   specified in the attribute.

   Each BGP Large Community value is encoded as a 12-octet quantity, as
   follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                      Global Administrator                     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                       Local Data Part 1                       |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                       Local Data Part 2                       |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Global Administrator:  A four-octet namespace identifier.

   Local Data Part 1:  A four-octet operator-defined value.

Internet-Draft            BGP Large Communities             January 2017


   Local Data Part 2:  A four-octet operator-defined value.

   The Global Administrator field is intended to allow different
   Autonomous Systems to define BGP Large Communities without collision.
   This field SHOULD be an Autonomous System Number (ASN), in which case
   the Local Data Parts are to be interpreted as defined by the owner of
   the ASN.  The use of Reserved ASNs (0 [RFC7607], 65535 and 4294967295
   [RFC7300]) is NOT RECOMMENDED.

   There is no significance to the order in which twelve-octet Large
   Community Attribute values are encoded in a Large Communities
   attribute, A BGP speaker can transmit them in any order.

   Duplicate BGP Large Community values MUST NOT be transmitted.  A
   receiving speaker MUST silently remove redundant BGP Large Community
   values from a BGP Large Community attribute.

3.  Aggregation

   If a range of routes is aggregated, then the resulting aggregate
   should have a BGP Large Communities attribute which contains all of
   the BGP Large Communities attributes from all of the aggregated
   routes.

4.  Canonical Representation

   The canonical representation of BGP Large Communities is three
   separate unsigned integers in decimal notation in the following
   order: Global Administrator, Local Data 1, Local Data 2.  Numbers
   MUST NOT contain leading zeros; a zero value MUST be represented with
   a single zero.  Each number is separated from the next by a single
   colon.  For example: 64496:4294967295:2, 64496:0:0.

   BGP Large Communities SHOULD be represented in the canonical
   representation.

5.  Error Handling

   The error handling of BGP Large Communities is as follows:

   o  A BGP Large Communities attribute SHALL be considered malformed if
      the length of the BGP Large Communities Attribute value, expressed
      in octets, is not a non-zero multiple of 12.

   o  A BGP Large Communities attribute SHALL NOT be considered
      malformed due solely to presence of duplicate community values.

Internet-Draft            BGP Large Communities             January 2017


   o  A BGP UPDATE message with a malformed BGP Large Communities
      attribute SHALL be handled using the approach of "treat-as-
      withdraw" as described in section 2 [RFC7606].

   The BGP Large Communities Global Administrator field may contain any
   value, and a BGP Large Communities attribute MUST NOT be considered
   malformed if the Global Administrator field contains an unallocated,
   unassigned or reserved ASN.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not change any underlying security issues
   associated with any other BGP Communities mechanism.  Specifically,
   an AS relying on the BGP Large Communities attribute carried in BGP
   must have trust in every other AS in the path, as any intermediate
   Autonomous System in the path may have added, deleted, or altered the
   BGP Large Communities attribute.  Specifying the mechanism to provide
   such trust is beyond the scope of this document.

   BGP Large Communities do not protect the integrity of each community
   value.  Operators should be aware that it is possible for a BGP
   speaker to alter BGP Large Community Attribute values in a BGP Update
   Message.  Protecting the integrity of the transitive handling of BGP
   Large Community attributes in a manner consistent with the intent of
   expressed BGP routing policies falls within the broader scope of
   securing BGP, and is not specifically addressed here.

   Network administrators should note the recommendations in Section 11
   of BGP Operations and Security [RFC7454].

7.  Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC7942.  The
   description of implementations in this section is intended to assist
   the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.
   Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here
   does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has
   been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied
   by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not be
   construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   As of today these vendors have produced an implementation of BGP
   Large Communities:

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has made an Early Allocation of the value 32 (LARGE_COMMUNITY)
   in the "BGP Path Attributes" registry under the "Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP) Parameters" group and is now asked to make that
   Permanent.
