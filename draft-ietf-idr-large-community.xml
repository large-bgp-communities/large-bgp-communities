            This document describes the BGP Large Communities attribute, an
            extension to BGP-4. This attribute provides a mechanism to
            signal opaque information within separate namespaces to aid in
            routing management. The attribute is suitable for use with
            four-octet Autonomous System Numbers.

      <section title="Introduction">
          <t>
              BGP implementations typically support a routing policy language
              to control the distribution of routing information.  Network
              operators attach BGP communities to routes to associate particular
              properties with these routes.  These properties may include
              information such as the route origin location, or specification
              of a routing policy action to be taken, or one that has been
              taken, and is applied to all routes contained in a BGP Update Message where
              the Communities Attribute is included.
              Because BGP communities are optional transitive BGP
              attributes, BGP communities may be acted upon or otherwise used
              by routing policies in other Autonomous Systems (ASes) on the
              Internet.
          </t>
          <t>
              BGP Communities attributes are a variable length attribute
              consisting of a set of one or more four-octet values, each of
              which specify a community <xref target="RFC1997"/>.  Common use
              of the individual values of this attribute type split this single
              32-bit value into two 16-bit values. The most significant word is
              interpreted as an Autonomous System Number (ASN) and the least
              significant word is a locally defined value whose meaning is
              assigned by the operator of the Autonomous System in the most
              significant word.
          </t>
          <t>
              Since the adoption of four-octet ASNs <xref target="RFC6793"/>, the
              BGP Communities attribute can no longer accommodate the above
              encoding, as a two-octet word cannot fit a four-octet ASN.
              The BGP Extended Communities attribute <xref target="RFC4360"/>
              is also unsuitable. The six-octet length of the Extended
              Community value precludes the common operational practise of
              encoding four-octet ASNs in both the Global Administrator and the
              Local Administrator sub-fields.
          </t>
          <t>
              To address these shortcomings, this document defines a BGP Large
              Communities attribute encoded as an unordered set of one or more
              twelve-octet values, each consisting of a four-octet Global
              Administrator field and two four-octet operator-defined fields,
              each of which can be used to denote properties or actions
              significant to the operator of the Autonomous System assigning
              the values.

        <t>
            This document defines the BGP Large Communities attribute
            as an optional transitive path attribute of variable length. All
            routes with the BGP Large Communities attribute belong to the
            communities specified in the attribute.
        </t>
        <t>
            Each BGP Large Community value is encoded as a 12-octet quantity,
            as follows:

            The Global Administrator field is intended to allow different
            Autonomous Systems to define BGP Large Communities without
            collision. This field SHOULD either be one of the reserved values
            as defined below, or an Autonomous System Number (ASN).  If it is a
            reserved value, then the Local Data Parts are as defined by the
            reserved value.  If it is an ASN then the Local Data Parts are to
            be interpreted as defined by the owner of the ASN.
        </t>
        <t>
            There is no significance to the order in which twelve-octet Large
            Community Attribute values are encoded in a Large Communities
            attribute,  A BGP speaker can transmit them in any order.
        </t>
        <t>
            Duplicate BGP Large Community values MUST NOT be transmitted. A
            receiving speaker MUST silently remove duplicate BGP Large
            Community values from a BGP Large Community attribute.
        </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Aggregation">
        <t>
            If a range of routes is aggregated, then the resulting aggregate
            should have a BGP Large Communities attribute which contains all
            of the BGP Large Communities attributes from all of the
            aggregated routes.
        </t>
    </section>

	<section title="Canonical Representation">
        <t>
            The canonical representation of BGP Large Communities is three
            separate unsigned integers in decimal notation in the following
            order: Global Administrator, Local Data 1, Local Data 2. Numbers
            MUST NOT contain leading zeros; a zero value MUST be represented
            with a single zero. Each number is separated from the next by a
            single colon. For example: 64496:4294967295:2, 64496:0:0.
        </t>
        <t>
            BGP Large Communities SHOULD be represented in the canonical
            representation.
        </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Reserved BGP Large Community values" anchor="reserved_vals">
        <t>
            The following Global Administrator values are reserved: 0, 65535,
            and 4294967295. Operators SHOULD NOT use these Global Administrator
            values.
        </t>
        <t>
            Although this document does not define any Special-Use BGP Large
            Communities, the Global Administrator values specified above could
            be used if there is a future need for them.
        </t>

    <section title="Error Handling">
        <t>
            The error handling of BGP Large Communities is as follows:
        </t>
        <t>
            <list style="symbols">
                <t>
                    A BGP Large Communities attribute SHALL be considered
                    malformed if the length of the BGP Large Communities
                    Attribute value, expressed in octets, is not a non-zero
                    multiple of 12.
                </t>
                <t>
                    A BGP Large Communities attribute SHALL NOT be considered
                    malformed due solely to presence of duplicate community
                    values.
                </t>
                <t>
                    A BGP UPDATE message with a malformed BGP Large Communities
                    attribute SHALL be handled using the approach of "treat-as-withdraw"
                    as described in <xref target="RFC7606">section 2</xref>.
                </t>
            </list>
        </t>
        <t>
            The BGP Large Communities Global Administrator field MAY contain
            any value, and a BGP Large Communities attribute MUST NOT be
            considered malformed if the Global Administrator field contains
            an unallocated, unassigned or reserved ASN or is set to one of
            the reserved BGP Large Community values defined in <xref
            target="reserved_vals" />.
        </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
        <t>
            This extension to BGP has similar security implications as BGP
            Communities <xref target="RFC1997"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
            This document does not change any underlying security issues
            associated with any other BGP Communities mechanism.  Specifically,
            an AS relying on the BGP Large Communities attribute carried in BGP
            must have trust in every other AS in the path, as any intermediate
            Autonomous System in the path may have added, deleted, or altered
            the BGP Large Communities attribute. Specifying the mechanism to
            provide such trust is beyond the scope of this document.
        </t>
        <t>
            BGP Large Communities do not protect the integrity of each
            community value. Operators should be aware that it is possible for
            a BGP speaker to alter BGP Large Community Attribute values in a
            BGP Update Message. Protecting the integrity of the transitive
            handling of BGP Large Community attributes in a manner consistent
            with the intent of expressed BGP routing policies falls within the
            broader scope of securing BGP, and is not specifically addressed
            here.
        </t>
        <t>
            Network administrators should note the recommendations in
            Section 11 of BGP Operations and Security <xref
            target="RFC7454"/>.
