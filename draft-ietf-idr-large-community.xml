            This document describes the Large BGP Communities attribute, an
            extension to BGP-4. This attribute provides a mechanism to
            signal opaque information within separate namespaces to aid in
            routing management. The attribute is suitable for use in four-octet
            ASNs.

      <section title="Introduction">
          <t>
              BGP implementations typically support a routing policy language
              to control the distribution of routing information.  Network
              operators attach BGP communities to routes to identify intrinsic
              properties of these routes.  These properties may include
              information such as the route origin location, or specification
              of a routing policy action to be taken, or one that has been
              taken, and may apply to an individual route or to a group of
              routes. Because BGP communities are optional transitive BGP
              attributes, BGP communities may be acted upon or otherwise used
              by routing policies in other Autonomous Systems (ASes) on the
              Internet.
          </t>
          <t>
              <xref target="RFC1997"/> BGP Communities attributes are
              four-octet values split into two two-octet words. The most
              significant word is interpreted as an Autonomous System Number
              (ASN) and the least significant word is a locally defined value
              whose meaning is assigned by the operator of the Autonomous
              System in the most significant word.
          </t>
          <t>
              Since the adoption of four-octet ASNs <xref target="RFC6793"/>, the
              BGP Communities attribute can no longer accommodate the above
              encoding, as a two-octet word cannot fit a four-octet ASN.  The BGP
              Extended Communities attribute <xref target="RFC4360"/> is also
              unsuitable, as the protocol limit of six octets cannot
              accommodate both a four-octet Global Administrator value and a
              four-octet Local Administrator value, which precludes the common
              operational practice of encoding a target ASN in the Local
              Administrator field.
          </t>
          <t>
              To address these shortcomings, this document defines a Large
              BGP Communities attribute encoded as one or more twelve-octet values,
              each consisting of a four-octet ASN and two four-octet operator-defined
              values, each of which can be used to denote properties or actions
              significant to that ASN.
          </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Large BGP Communities Attribute">
        <t>
            This document creates the Large BGP Communities attribute
            as an optional transitive path attribute of variable length.  All
            routes with the Large BGP Communities attribute belong to the
            community specified in the attribute.
        </t>
        <t>
            The attribute consists of one or more twelve-octet values. Each
            twelve-octet Large BGP Communities value represents three four-octet values, as
            follows:

            The Global Administrator field is intended to allow different
            Autonomous Systems to define Large BGP Communities without collision.

            There is no significance to the order in which Large BGP Communities
            are encoded in the BGP path attribute payload and a receiving speaker
            MAY retransmit them in an order different from which it received
            them.

        <t>
            Duplicate Large BGP Communities SHOULD NOT be transmitted.  A

    <section title="Aggregation">
        <t>
            If a range of routes is aggregated, then the resulting aggregate
            should have a Large BGP Communities attribute which contains all
            of the Large BGP Communities attributes from all of the
            aggregated routes.
        </t>
    </section>

	<section title="Canonical Representation">
        <t>
            Large BGP Communities MUST be represented as three separate
            unsigned decimal numbers, without leading zeros, in the following
            order: Global Administrator, Local Data 1, Local Data 2. Numbers
            MUST not be omitted, even when zero.  For example:
            64496:4294967295:2 or 64496:0:0 or (64496, 111, 222).

            The following Global Administrator values are reserved: 0 (the
            first ASN) <xref target="RFC7607"/>, 65535 (UINT_MAX) and
            4294967295 (the last ASN) <xref target="RFC7300"/>.  Operators
            SHOULD NOT use these Global Administrator values.
        </t>
        <t>
            Although this document does not define any Special-Use Large BGP
            Communities, the Global Administrator values specified above could
            be used if there is a future need for them.

            The error handling of Large BGP Communities is as follows:

            <list style="symbols">
                <t>
                    A Large BGP Communities attribute with a length of zero

                </t>
                <t>
                    A Large BGP Communities attribute SHALL be considered malformed
                    if its length is not a non-zero multiple of 12 bytes.
                </t>
                <t>
                    A BGP UPDATE message with a malformed Large BGP Communities
                    attribute SHALL be handled using the approach of "treat-as-withdraw"
                    as described in <xref target="RFC7606">section 2</xref>.
                </t>
            </list>
        </t>
        <t>
            The Large BGP Communities Global Administrator field may contain
            any value, and a Large BGP Communities attribute MUST NOT be
            considered malformed if the Global Administrator field contains
            an unallocated, unassigned or reserved ASN or is set to one of
            the reserved Large BGP Community values defined in <xref
            target="reserved_vals" />.

    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
        <t>
            This extension to BGP has similar security implications as BGP
            Communities <xref target="RFC1997"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
            This document does not change any underlying security issues
            associated with any other BGP Communities mechanism.  Specifically,
            an AS relying on the Large BGP Communities attribute carried in BGP
            must have trust in every other AS in the path, as any intermediate
            Autonomous System in the path may have added, deleted or altered
            the Large BGP Communities attribute. Specifying the mechanism to
            provide such trust is beyond the scope of this document.
        </t>
        <t>
            Network administrators should note the recommendations in
            Section 11 of BGP Operations and Security <xref

           This section records the status of known implementations of the

           this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in

           information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
           This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog
