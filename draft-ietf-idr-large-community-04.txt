Abstract

   This document describes the Large BGP Communities attribute, an
   extension to BGP-4.  This attribute provides a mechanism to signal
   opaque information within separate namespaces to aid in routing
   management.  The attribute is suitable for use in four-octet ASNs.

1.  Introduction

   BGP implementations typically support a routing policy language to
   control the distribution of routing information.  Network operators
   attach BGP communities to routes to identify intrinsic properties of
   these routes.  These properties may include information such as the
   route origin location, or specification of a routing policy action to
   be taken, or one that has been taken, and may apply to an individual
   route or to a group of routes.  Because BGP communities are optional
   transitive BGP attributes, BGP communities may be acted upon or
   otherwise used by routing policies in other Autonomous Systems (ASes)
   on the Internet.

   [RFC1997] BGP Communities attributes are four-octet values split into
   two two-octet words.  The most significant word is interpreted as an

Internet-Draft            Large BGP Communities             October 2016


   Autonomous System Number (ASN) and the least significant word is a
   locally defined value whose meaning is assigned by the operator of
   the Autonomous System in the most significant word.

   Since the adoption of four-octet ASNs [RFC6793], the BGP Communities
   attribute can no longer accommodate the above encoding, as a two-
   octet word cannot fit a four-octet ASN.  The BGP Extended Communities
   attribute [RFC4360] is also unsuitable, as the protocol limit of six
   octets cannot accommodate both a four-octet Global Administrator
   value and a four-octet Local Administrator value, which precludes the
   common operational practice of encoding a target ASN in the Local
   Administrator field.

   To address these shortcomings, this document defines a Large BGP
   Communities attribute encoded as one or more twelve-octet values,
   each consisting of a four-octet ASN and two four-octet operator-
   defined values, each of which can be used to denote properties or
   actions significant to that ASN.

2.  Large BGP Communities Attribute

   This document creates the Large BGP Communities attribute as an
   optional transitive path attribute of variable length.  All routes
   with the Large BGP Communities attribute belong to the community
   specified in the attribute.

   The attribute consists of one or more twelve-octet values.  Each
   twelve-octet Large BGP Communities value represents three four-octet
   values, as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                      Global Administrator                     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                       Local Data Part 1                       |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                       Local Data Part 2                       |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Global Administrator:  A four-octet namespace identifier.  This
      SHOULD be an Autonomous System Number.

   Local Data Part 1:  A four-octet operator-defined value.

   Local Data Part 2:  A four-octet operator-defined value.

Internet-Draft            Large BGP Communities             October 2016


   The Global Administrator field is intended to allow different
   Autonomous Systems to define Large BGP Communities without collision.
   Implementations MUST allow the operator to specify any value for the
   Global Administrator field.

   There is no significance to the order in which Large BGP Communities
   are encoded in the BGP path attribute payload.  A BGP speaker can
   transmit them in any order.

   Duplicate Large BGP Communities SHOULD NOT be transmitted.  A
   receiving speaker SHOULD silently remove duplicate Large BGP
   Communities from a BGP UPDATE message.

3.  Aggregation

   If a range of routes is aggregated, then the resulting aggregate
   should have a Large BGP Communities attribute which contains all of
   the Large BGP Communities attributes from all of the aggregated
   routes.

4.  Canonical Representation

   Large BGP Communities MUST be represented as three separate unsigned
   integers in decimal notation, without leading zeros, in the following
   order: Global Administrator, Local Data 1, Local Data 2.  Numbers
   MUST not be omitted, even when zero.  For example: 64496:4294967295:2
   or 64496:0:0 or (64496, 111, 222).

5.  Reserved Large BGP Community values

   The following Global Administrator values are reserved: 0 (the first
   ASN) [RFC7607], 65535 (UINT_MAX) and 4294967295 (the last ASN)
   [RFC7300].  Operators SHOULD NOT use these Global Administrator
   values.

   Although this document does not define any Special-Use Large BGP
   Communities, the Global Administrator values specified above could be
   used if there is a future need for them.

6.  Error Handling

   The error handling of Large BGP Communities is as follows:

   o  A Large BGP Communities attribute with a length of zero MUST be
      ignored upon receipt and removed when sending.

   o  A Large BGP Communities attribute SHALL be considered malformed if
      its length is not a non-zero multiple of 12.

Internet-Draft            Large BGP Communities             October 2016


   o  A BGP UPDATE message with a malformed Large BGP Communities
      attribute SHALL be handled using the approach of "treat-as-
      withdraw" as described in section 2 [RFC7606].

   The Large BGP Communities Global Administrator field may contain any
   value, and a Large BGP Communities attribute MUST NOT be considered
   malformed if the Global Administrator field contains an unallocated,
   unassigned or reserved ASN or is set to one of the reserved Large BGP
   Community values defined in Section 5.

7.  Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP has similar security implications as BGP
   Communities [RFC1997].

   This document does not change any underlying security issues
   associated with any other BGP Communities mechanism.  Specifically,
   an AS relying on the Large BGP Communities attribute carried in BGP
   must have trust in every other AS in the path, as any intermediate
   Autonomous System in the path may have added, deleted or altered the
   Large BGP Communities attribute.  Specifying the mechanism to provide
   such trust is beyond the scope of this document.

   Network administrators should note the recommendations in Section 11
   of BGP Operations and Security [RFC7454].

8.  Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   As of today these vendors have produced an implementation of Large
   BGP Communities:

   o  Cisco IOS XR

   o  ExaBGP

   o  GoBGP

   o  BIRD

   o  OpenBGPD

   o  pmacct

   The latest implementation news is tracked at
   http://largebgpcommunities.net/ [1].

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has made an Early Allocation of the value 30 (LARGE_COMMUNITY)
   in the "BGP Path Attributes" registry under the "Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP) Parameters" group and is now asked to make that
   Permanent.
